# Double Pivot Mechanism
A project for an engineering design course ESC102.
The Double-Pivot Mechanism design aims to enable hockey players with disabilities to manoeuvre the hockey stick easily and precisely using a joystick controller. This mechanism aims to achieve three movements that are important to hockey players; manipulating, shooting and blocking the ball. This will in turn increase their involvement in the game.
