# Dual-Pivot Mechanism

## Introduction

The Dual-Pivot Mechanism is an engineering design project created for the ESC102 course. This project aims to design a mechanism that will enable hockey players with disabilities to move their hockey stick using a joystick controller with ease and precision. The mechanism will enable the players to achieve three essential movements in hockey, i.e., manipulating, shooting, and blocking the ball. By increasing their involvement in the game, this project will help make hockey more inclusive.

## Explanation of Project and Code

The Dual-Pivot Mechanism project aims to design a mechanism that will enable hockey players with disabilities to use a joystick controller to move their hockey stick with precision and ease. The project involves designing and building a mechanism that will enable players to achieve three essential movements in hockey: manipulating, shooting, and blocking the ball.

The code involved in this project includes software to control the joystick, which will be used to move the hockey stick. The software will use an algorithm that translates joystick movements into hockey stick movements, allowing players to control their stick with ease and precision.

## Special Considerations

When designing the Dual-Pivot Mechanism, several special considerations were taken into account. These considerations include:

- The mechanism must be lightweight, so it does not add unnecessary weight to the hockey stick, making it difficult for the players to maneuver.
- The mechanism must be easy to install and remove, allowing players to switch between the Dual-Pivot Mechanism and a regular stick easily.
- The mechanism must be durable and withstand the wear and tear of regular use during hockey games.

## Examples

To demonstrate the functionality of the Dual-Pivot Mechanism, several videos and images will be included in the final project report. These videos and images will showcase the mechanism's ability to enable players to achieve the three essential movements in hockey with ease and precision.
